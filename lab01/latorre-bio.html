    My name is Lindsey Latorre. I am double-majoring in Real Estate and Finance, interested in expanding my knowledge on the world of residential and commercial real estate and their affiliation with the financial sector. 
I am exceptionally skilled in customer service and sales. I am proficient in Spanish, CAD, and Solidworks. 
I enjoy being outdoors and on the water. I love boating, jet skiing, fishing, and four-wheeling. My favorite shows are Jeopardy!, Selling Sunset, and Money Heist. My favorite movie is The Hateful Eight.
